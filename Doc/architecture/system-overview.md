# System Overview

## Introduction

SattvaBite is a cloud-native food ordering platform built using microservices architecture. This document provides a high-level overview of the system's architecture, components, and their interactions.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Components

1. **API Gateway**
   - Single entry point for all client requests
   - Handles authentication, authorization, and request routing
   - Implements rate limiting and request/response transformation

2. **Service Discovery (Eureka)**
   - Enables dynamic service registration and discovery
   - Facilitates load balancing and failover
   - Maintains service health status

3. **Core Services**
   - **Order Service**: Manages order lifecycle and processing
   - **Food Catalog Service**: Handles menu items and food-related data
   - **Restaurant Service**: Manages restaurant information and operations
   - **User Service**: Handles user authentication and profile management
   - **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users and restaurants

4. **Supporting Services**
   - **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management
   - **Message Broker (Kafka)**: Handles asynchronous communication between services
   - **Distributed Tracing (Zipkin/Jaeger)**: Provides end-to-end request tracing
   - **Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)**: System monitoring and alerting

### Data Storage

- **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**: Primary data store for transactional data
- **Document Store (MongoDB)**: For flexible schema requirements
- **Cache (Redis)**: For high-speed data access and session management
- **Search Engine (Elasticsearch)**: For full-text search capabilities

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Cloud
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **API Documentation**: SpringDoc OpenAPI 3.0

### Frontend (Future)
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Styling**: Material-UI

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local development using Docker Compose
- Each service runs in its own container
- Shared development database and message broker

### Staging/Production Environment
- Kubernetes cluster
- Multiple availability zones for high availability
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates

## Security

- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Compliance**: GDPR, PCI-DSS (for payment processing)
- **Audit Logging**: All sensitive operations are logged

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Multi-level caching strategy
- **Database Optimization**: Read replicas, indexing, and query optimization
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture
- **CDN Integration**: For static assets and media files

## Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless services can be scaled independently
- **Database Sharding**: For handling large datasets
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write models for better performance
- **Event Sourcing**: For maintaining audit trails and enabling temporal queries

## Reliability

- **Circuit Breakers**: To prevent cascading failures
- **Retry Mechanisms**: With exponential backoff
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: To isolate failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Essential features remain available during partial failures

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Metrics**: Prometheus for collecting and storing metrics
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with ELK Stack
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- **Alerting**: AlertManager for notifications

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**
   - Personalized recommendations
   - Demand forecasting
   - Dynamic pricing

2. **Real-time Analytics**
   - Order tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - Business intelligence

3. **Multi-language Support**
   - Internationalization (i18n)
   - Localization (l10n)

4. **Mobile Applications**
   - iOS and Android native apps
   - Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Conclusion

This system overview provides a comprehensive look at the SattvaBite architecture. The microservices-based approach ensures scalability, maintainability, and flexibility for future growth. Each component is designed to be independently deployable and scalable, with a strong focus on reliability and performance.
